Increasingly, admissions officers are depending upon the intangibles essays, letters of recommendation, interviews to guide their decisions.

Students who want to \\u2018tip\\u2019 the scale in their favor can benefit from the professional experience that our experienced team offers. We are able to provide the individualized attention that many guidance counselors cannot offer. We strongly believe that a majority of high school guidance counselors are qualified, well trained, dedicated, and very knowledgeable about the admissions process. Unfortunately, there simply is a limited amount of time and attention that a guidance counselor can give to any one individual student. In the U.S., the ratio of students to guidance counselors is 478:1. Counselors also have a myriad of duties besides college counseling. We limit the number of students we work with so our students receive the attention and assistance they require. This can be particularly useful for students who have trouble organizing themselves, difficulty getting started, or who thrive on structure and one-on-one attention. Our aim is to empower students. The choice of college is the first of many life-altering, independent decisions they will make. The stress they face is enormous and often overwhelming for even the most gifted students. Our goal is to decrease this stress as much as possible by making the admissions process more manageable. We also recognize that the admissions process may be confusing and quite stressful for parents. We make every attempt to provide parents with information, guidance, and support during this period. Senior year in high school is naturally a time of separation from parents. As a result, the application process is often fraught with struggles for control and autonomy. We try to minimize this struggle so that we manage the admissions process and you can interact with your children around less charged issues.\"\n              }, void 0, false, {\n                fileName: _jsxFileName,\n                lineNumber: 38,\n                columnNumber: 17\n              }, this)]\n            }, void 0, true, {\n              fileName: _jsxFileName,\n              lineNumber: 36,\n              columnNumber: 15\n            }, this)\n          }, void 0, false, {\n            fileName: _jsxFileName,\n            lineNumber: 35,\n            columnNumber: 13\n          }, this)]\n        }, void 0, true, {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 31,\n          columnNumber: 11\n        }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"div\", {\n          className: \"row svc-area__box\",\n          children: [/*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"div\", {\n            className: \"col-1-of-2\",\n            children: /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"div\", {\n              className: \"svc-area__text\",\n              children: [/*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"h2\", {\n                className: \"svc-area__title\",\n                children: \"Educational counselling\"\n              }, void 0, false, {\n                fileName: _jsxFileName,\n                lineNumber: 75,\n                columnNumber: 17\n              }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"div\", {\n                className: \"svc-area__paragraph\",\n                children: \"Owing to intense competition and peer pressure students often face a dilemma to make the right career choice for them.

Increasingly, admissions officers are depending\n                  upon the intangibles essays, letters of recommendation, interviews to guide their\n                  decisions. With so many applicants presenting similar scores and grades,\n                  admissions professionals are utilizing these supporting materials to differentiate\n                  candidates. Students who want to ‘tip’ the scale in their favor can benefit from\n                  the professional experience that our experienced team offers. We are able to\n                  provide the individualized attention that many guidance counselors cannot offer.\n                  We strongly believe that a majority of high school guidance counselors are\n                  qualified, well trained, dedicated, and very knowledgeable about the admissions\n                  process. Unfortunately, there simply is a limited amount of time and attention\n                  that a guidance counselor can give to any one individual student. In the U.S., the\n                  ratio of students to guidance counselors is 478:1. Counselors also have a myriad\n                  of duties besides college counseling. We limit the number of students we work with\n                  so our students receive the attention and assistance they require. This can be\n                  particularly useful for students who have trouble organizing themselves,\n                  difficulty getting started, or who thrive on structure and one-on-one attention.\n                  Our aim is to empower students. The choice of college is the first of many\n                  life-altering, independent decisions they will make. The stress they face is\n                  enormous and often overwhelming for even the most gifted students. Our goal is to\n                  decrease this stress as much as possible by making the admissions process more\n                  manageable. We also recognize that the admissions process may be confusing and\n                  quite stressful for parents. We make every attempt to provide parents with\n                  information, guidance, and support during this period. Senior year in high school\n                  is naturally a time of separation from parents. As a result, the application\n                  process is often fraught with struggles for control and autonomy. We try to\n                  minimize this struggle so that we manage the admissions process and you can\n                  interact with your children around less charged issues.\n                </div>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n\n          <div className='row svc-area__box'>\n            <div className='col-1-of-2'>\n              <div className='svc-area__text'>\n                <h2 className='svc-area__title'>Educational counselling</h2>\n                <div className='svc-area__paragraph'>\n                  Owing to intense competition and peer pressure students often face a dilemma to\n                  make the right career choice for them.
