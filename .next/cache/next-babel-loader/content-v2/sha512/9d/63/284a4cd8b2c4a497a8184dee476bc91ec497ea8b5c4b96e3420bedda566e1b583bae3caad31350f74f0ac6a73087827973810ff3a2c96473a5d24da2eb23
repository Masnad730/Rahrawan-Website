Increasingly, admissions officers are\n                    depending upon the intangibles essays, letters of recommendation, interviews to\n                    guide their decisions. With so many applicants presenting similar scores and\n                    grades, admissions professionals are utilizing these supporting materials to\n                    differentiate candidates.

Unfortunately, there simply is a\n                    limited amount of time and attention that a guidance counselor can give to any\n                    one individual student. In the U.S., the ratio of students to guidance\n                    counselors is 478:1. Counselors also have a myriad of duties besides college\n                    counseling. We limit the number of students we work with so our students receive\n                    the attention and assistance they require. This can be particularly useful for\n                    students who have trouble organizing themselves, difficulty getting started, or\n                    who thrive on structure and one-on-one attention.\n                  </p>\n                  <p className='svc-area__txt'>\n                    Our aim is to empower students. The choice of college is the first of many\n                    life-altering, independent decisions they will make. The stress they face is\n                    enormous and often overwhelming for even the most gifted students. Our goal is\n                    to decrease this stress as much as possible by making the admissions process\n                    more manageable.\n                  </p>\n                  <p className='svc-area__txt'>\n                    We also recognize that the admissions process may be confusing and quite\n                    stressful for parents. We make every attempt to provide parents with\n                    information, guidance, and support during this period. Senior year in high\n                    school is naturally a time of separation from parents. As a result, the\n                    application process is often fraught with struggles for control and autonomy. We\n                    try to minimize this struggle so that we manage the admissions process and you\n                    can interact with your children around less charged issues.\n                  </p>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <div\n                className={toggleState === 2 ?

We believe that students would\n                    never want to land in a country with a course, which is not suitable as per\n                    his/her, interest and career goals. We have great experts in our counseling\n                    team, who have the ability to assess the information provided by the students.\n                    We ask students to provide their basic information so that we may get to know\n                    about them. The basic information provided by students is analyzed and assessed\n                    by experts to move further to identify which college, university and country\n                    would be the best fit for the students as per his/her profile.\n                  </p>\n                  <p className='svc-area__txt'>\n                    To prepare a detailed student profile, we not only take basic information but\n                    our counselors also brief students about a range of options. It means that it is\n                    a process, where things start from a broad perspective, but we slowly narrow it\n                    down to come up with the best choice for the students. It can only be done with\n                    the proper profiling of the student. We also welcome parents of students to get\n                    in touch with us so that we can make a comprehensive profile of students. It is\n                    important to mention here that whatever information is shared by students or\n                    his/her parents; we keep it confidential in the best possible manner. So, you\n                    can share anything with us without worrying about the confidentiality of the\n                    information.\n                  </p>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <div\n                className={toggleState === 3 ?
